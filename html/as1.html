          Wildlife Photography
        </h2>
        <p>
          In today’s modern world, natural settings are rapidly diminishing. This means that the wildlife that lives in these natural settings is diminishing as well. In fact, scientists estimate that human encroachment causes several animal species to become extinct each and every day.

Preserving these natural settings and this wildlife can be rather difficult, but there are now programs in place to help prevent this. In the meantime, however, some professionals are using this time to preserve this precious wildlife in a different way – with photographs.

Wildlife photography is a type of photography that focuses on taking photographs of wildlife, or non-domesticated animals. This type of photography is important not only for its artistic value, but also for its scientific value as well.

Unlike many other types of photography that rely on staged and posed subjects, wildlife photography does not. The subjects in this type of photography are wild animals, and they are usually captured as such. For instance, a lion could be photographed protecting herself from the hot sun under a shade tree or in mid-pounce while bringing down prey. Although it is possible to trap and pose captive wild animals, this is generally frowned upon and usually reserved for scientific purposes

        <h2>
          Capturing moments
        </h2>
        <p>
          As a professional photographer, I have never thought of photography in terms of capturing the moment.

Capturing genuine moments – for sure, that is the goal of every photographer. But, genuine moments are different than random accidental moments when a photographer happens to get lucky.

To me, “capture the moment” basically means: Put your camera in program auto and high speed burst, take 5000 photos of a wedding, a few will be nice moments – and voilà – you are a capture the moment photographer!

I take pictures for money.  I need to be good, not lucky.

I see photography more along the lines of first creating moments, then photographing them as they unfold.

For example, capturing a rock climber at sunrise in the process of sticking a daring grab with a gorgeous vista in the background is not capturing the moment.  It’s planned and calculated.  Sure, it’s a genuine moment, but there is nothing random or lucky about getting that shot.

(Well, OK, sometimes you do get a little lucky.  Every photography shoot has at least one curveball – sometimes you get an unexpected home run.)

But the point is, I never really believed in the concept of “capture the moment”.  Until it happened.

          Landscape
        </h2>
        <p>
          A good landscape picture should make a connection with the viewer, and tell you a story. A good landscape picture will have you finding interesting details in the photo for several months after you first see it.
The skill is to entertain the viewer within the singular moment of the photo. Capturing the instant in time, and preserving it forever, can make it into something amazing.
It can remind you of a certain location, a certain point in time, or a period of your life.Landscape photography typically requires relatively simple photographic equipment, though more sophisticated equipment can give a wider range of possibilities to the art. An artist's eye for the subject can yield attractive and impressive results even with modest equipmentAny ordinary (or sophisticated) camera -- film camera or digital camera—can be readily used for common landscape photography. Higher-resolution and larger-format digital cameras (or larger-format film cameras) permit a greater amount of detail and a wider range of artistic presentation.

However, a larger-format camera yields a more limited depth of field (range of the scene that is in focus) for a given aperture value, requiring greater care in focusing (see: "Shutter Speed and Aperture", below).

A camera with "panorama" function or frame can permit very wide images suitable for capturing a panoramic view
